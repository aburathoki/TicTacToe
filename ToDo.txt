# To do

1) Change tictactoe class name to e.g. GAmeRules
2) Game class needs to manage state of game, 
   - toggle player_to_play (this might need to be removed from TicTacToe class as well)
   â€“ Game needs to get grid from icTacTo class at end of move
3) Return to AI!!!!

4) write a test to rank those moves
